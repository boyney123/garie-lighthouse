## Overview of garie-lighthouse

Garie-lighthouse was developed as a plugin for the [Garie](https://github.com/boyney123/garie) Architecture.

[Garie](https://github.com/boyney123/garie) is an out the box web performance toolkit, and `garie-lighthouse` is a plugin that generates and stores lighthouse data into `InfluxDB`.

`Garie-lighthouse` can also be run outside the `Garie` environment and run as standalone.

If your interested in an out the box solution that supports multiple performance tools like `lighthouse`, `google-speed-insight` and `web-page-test` then checkout [Garie](https://github.com/boyney123/garie).

If you want to run `garie-lighthouse` standalone you can find out how below.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed

### Running garie-lighthouse

You can get setup with the basics in a few minutes.

First clone the repo.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:boyney123/garie-lighthouse.git
```

Next setup you're config. Edit the `config.json` and add websites to the list.

```javascript
{
	"cron": "00 00 */6 * * *",
	"urls": [
		{
			"url": "https://www.comparethemarket.com",
			"report": true
		},
		{
			"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk",
			"report": true
		},
		{
			"url": "https://www.cnn.com",
			"report": true
		}
	]
}
```

Once you finished edited your config, lets build our docker image and setup our environment.

```sh
docker build -t garie-lighthouse . && docker-compose up
```

This will build your copy of `garie-lighthouse` and run the application.

On start garie-lighthouse will start to gather performance metrics for the websites added to the `config.json`.

## Data collected

Lighthouse comes with loads of audits out the box. You can view all metrics in the reports.

Garie-lighthouse filters what data is stored into influxDB and returned in the webhook.

## Viewing reports

Viewing lighthouse reports is straight forward. Once you have your application running just go to `localhost:3000/reports` and you should see all the reports lighthouse has generated.

![reports](./screenshots/reports.png 'Reports')
![reports](./screenshots/lighthouse.png 'Reports')

If you don't want to generate reports you can turn this off in the `config.json` by setting `report` to false.

## Webhook

Garie-lighthouse also supports webhooks. You will need to `POST` to `localhost:3000/collect`.
